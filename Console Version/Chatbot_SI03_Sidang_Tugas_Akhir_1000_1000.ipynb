       "14971  I not only use these to listen to instruments through a pre-amp (Korg N5 keyboard, electric and acoustic guitars, bass) but also as a \"Monitor\" for recording and digitizing tracks mixed with my mixing/mastering software, and while recording as a \"monitor\" when microphones are in use so that background \"playback\" tracks I am plaing along WITH don't get \"ghosted\" on the new recorded track... (if any of THAT makes any sense! lol!) ANYWAY... I have found them to be EXCELLENT and a great value for the price. You may be able to find better, but you'd be hard-pressed to actually HEAR a difference, and you'd pay a WHOLE LOT MORE. More... I think anything more expensive than these wonderful headphones is going to put you up against a \"point of diminishing returns.\" (You could pay more but you wouldn't necessarily GET more for it.)  \n",

       "14991  There are two differences. The first is the packaging. The FL-UDRV comes in a nice, glossy, colorful box. The SBT-UFDB comes in a plain brown cardboard box with black printing. The second difference is the inclusion of a CD-ROM containing (fairly useless) driver software. The FL-UDRV comes with the CD; the SBT-UFDB does not. The actual drive hardware is identical. I confirmed this by checking the Sabrent website.

      "light\tI think this is one of the first editions of the Nook. No, it doesn't have a light. The newest editions, like Nook HD and HD+ have a lighted screen that you can adjust for your own convenience. Since they have been out for awhile, you might be able to get a good buy on one over the internet. I highly recommend paying some extra dollars. I have them both and they are terrific. You also might be able to get one refurbished for less money but will work just as well. Caution, if you buy a used or refurbished nook, or even a new one that is listed on sale, make sure that it doesn't have a previous owner's membership on it. Otherwise you won't be able to use the internet. Most manufacturers or sellers will have email access and you can ask them if it had a previous owners data on it. Beware of buying one from a single resident seller, because they might not have gone through the procedures to remove their ownership data.\n",

There is a great, free program which allows you to organize and convert your ebook library from any format, to any other format. Download Calibre onto your computer and use it to convert Amazon books to the nook friendly EPUB format. http://calibre-ebook.com/\n",
      "books nook purchase amazon go barnes &amp noble\tYou can purchase the kindle versions of books on amazon and pretty easily get them onto your nook. Basically you download the amazon kindle desktop reading app, download the books you want to your pc, and find the folder that they are in. Then you download a free and very popular e-book library management program called calibri and a plugin for it that lets it decrypt kindle files. All you have to do from there is go into calibri's settings and point it to the kindle directory on your pc and it will import them and you can put them onto your nook using the calibri interface. There are guides out there that lay it all out and have screenshots, so literally anyone can do it, and calibri is worth having for anyone with a serious e-book collection anyway as you can tag books with all sorts of info to help you find them easier.\n",
      "download books need school collageuniversity\tDepends on the book. If you're looking for textbooks, I don't think many are offered for viewing on the Nook Simple Touch. Best bet is to just check the titles you're looking for on barnesandnoble.com.\n",
      "wifi mean transfer computer also\tSome higher end eReaders have the capability to access the internet like a smart phone. Wifi only just means that you need to be near a wireless location that will allow you access (home, hotspots like bookstores, coffee shops, etc...). Your charging cable is also a data cable for connecting your reader to your PC for transfer of books that way. Hope this helps.\n",

So far, I 've never connected the device on the internet. \"There are issues with B&N registration and purchasing policies though, so here's a legal hack to overcome the registration process and use Nook offline. Of course, you won't be able to use B&N bookstore this way. Power it up but don't enter setup. Hold the right/up \"button\" and drag your finger to the top of the screen, from left to right. A \"Factory\" button appears, so press it and go to the \"Factory\" menu. Again, Hold the right top key and tap somewhere in the emtpy space at the bottom right of the screen. A \"Skip Oobe\" frame should appear. Tap it and you are done. You don't have to register, give credit card info or whatever. Your kudos to Terence Eden's blog.\"\n",

      "version camera\tNo, Nook Glowlight does not have a camera.\n",
      "anyone compare nook glowlight nook color know tablet ignore part compare ereader part\tA major advantage of the Nook Glowlight is the ability to read outside both in both direct or indirect sunlight without the screen \"fading\" or screen glare as well as being able to read anywhere indoors or at night with the Glowlight function. The battery life of the Glowlight is significantly longer and the device is much lighter and easier to hold and carry especially while traveling. There is the disadvantage though of books only being available in black and while, which could be an issue for books for children or books with photos or pictures in them. The Main advantage of the Nook Color is the color feature, especially for magazines, etc. and the text is a bit crisper and the lighting better. It also has a night time setting (dark screen/white lettering) for reading at night which doesn't light up a room as much for the benefit of other occupants. Being a tablet gives internet capability, but this does mean a shorter battery life. It is also difficult, if not impossible to read it outdoors. Both products are excellent. Since I have an iPad and can access my Nook library in color, I have opted for the Glowlight so I can read outdoors on my patio. Best of both worlds.\n",

Your NOOK GlowLight has fonts that support languages based on a Latin character set for reading foreign language books, periodicals, and other digital content. Some examples of supported languages include: Afrikaans, Basque, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish. Your NOOK GlowLight may support books from other languages, but only if the foreign language characters are embedded in the font library of the digital file itself or if the file is a PDF file rendered as a graphic image.\n",

I have done that with my Sony, Kobo & Smashwords ebooks. I used to have a Sony ereader, and when I switched to nook, I downloaded the Sony ebooks to my computer, hooked up my nook to the computer, and dragged the ebook files to an SD card that I had loaded on my nook. Same with my Kobo & Smashword ebooks. Another option would be to see if there is a BooksAMillion app in the google play store. You could load the app on your nook, sign in to your BooksAMillion account on the app, and your library will show up within the app. I also just went to the BooksAMillion website and it appears that they used to sell Nook devices on their site, so I'm sure that would indicate it is compatible. Hope these suggestions are helpful and you can always visit a Barnes & Noble store Nook counter and the sales staff can assist you with any questions.\n",

      "rooted nook experience please share experience rooted nook long take root\tIt took less than 5 minutes to root (and that was mostly \"burning\" the bootable image to the SD card). There are NO disadvantages. If you ever have a problem, it's quite easy to return the Nook Color to factory conditions (and therefor in-warranty status). A rooted Nook Color is just as fast as any other tablet running an 800 Mhz ARM processor, faster if you overclock it (though this is a bit more technically advanced than just rooting it). It'll safely overclock to 1 Ghz, and many report successfully OCing it to 1.1 Ghz. XDA-Developers has the latest news on all the rooted versions, and the other versions of Android you can install (you can run Froyo or Honeycomb from SD card, and not even mess with your stock setup. Slight tradeoff in speed, but doesn't void your warranty). As long as you back up your system, an autoupdate won't bother you. You can also turn off autoupdating (though it's not as simple as clicking on a \"don't autoupdate\" box). Plain and simple, while the Nook Color is a very nice E-reader, it's a FANTASTIC Android tablet. I'm running Zeam as my launcher, I'm using an animated wallpaper, I'm playing Gameboy Advanced games on it, I've got my contacts and calendar synced with Gmail and Outlook, I've even tethered it to my phone's wifi for internet service where there's no wifi available.\n",

It was MUCH easier than rooting my Galaxy S phone. I am having a blast with my new tablet computer. I watched a Netflix movie start to finish yesterday with nary a stutter.

      "nook uk problem live uk heard may compatible\tDear Michelle, I finally got my Nook for Christmas. Not without some extra taxes I had to pay in the border, but anyway, finally here. I think that for reading novels in Catalan it's perfect really. The contrast of the screen depends much on the light you put in, but if the light is totally white, the constrast is very good!!! I'm pretty happy with the Nook, even if I cannot purchase directly any book because I don't have US billing address. The only little problem I found when reading for long time, is that because of the outside plastic it gets stuck on the hand and I have to change the position of reading every 15-20 minuts. I suppose once I get the cover I asked, I could handle in another way and the problem won't come back. One very bad experience!! I purchased the cover on Barnes&Noble and because is going to Europe you cannot track it. The point is that after more than one month it has not arrived yet!! But the worse is that the 2 times I send a mail to B&N they automatically resent me a mail forwarding me to the help system!!! I finally sent another e-mail to the company external of B&N that produces the covers for them and I didn't get any answer yet!! So I finally purchased it on Amazon. By the way I also bought a Kindle and it's supposed to arrive in a couple days. I bought it for the textbooks for my studies. Give me some feedback!!! Take care. Xavi\n",

I decided to purchase the Logitech Revue to replace my Roku box thinking i would prefer the full keyboard, but the Revue has been nothing but frustrating. Accessing netflix is hit-or-miss, the browser keeps on crashing, and it is altogether slow and annoying. I don't think Google TV is the problem because it seemed to work well on the Sony device, and I never had a problem access Netflix on my Roku. So I am returning the Roku and getting the Sony. To answer your question, the problems experienced on the Revue did not occur on the Sony, in my experience. I suspect Logitech has dropped the price in order to unload the remaining units and have given up on th is product. Hope this helps.\n",

I am in the process of getting ready to write a review, but to address your specific question: Yes, it is an excellent choice for a work monitor. The screen real estate at native resolution is simply enormous. If you have Windows 8, I would suggest setting the font size to 125 percent or 150 percent, otherwise there might be some readability issues. This does not work as well with Windows 7, but you can try it. I use mine for video editing, coding, general web-surfing, gaming, etc. You can easily fit several windows on the screen without any issue. I currently use a 24 inch 1:9 monitor in portrait mode in conjunction with the Yamakasi. It works great for my needs, and you if you use a lot of applications, you might want to consider using another monitor as well. To give you an idea of how large the Yamakasi is, the 24 inch 16:9 monitor in portrait mode is only several inches taller than the Yamakasi in landscape.\n",

However, if they shipped the old style units, the cable would be an old printer cable (IEEE 488) which is not found on most modern PC's. I bought this unit that is linked to the photo on this question and it was USB and worked fine. You may be referring to the second piece of the power cable as it comes as a short cable to teh transformer, then the transformer and a longer cable to the wall socket. One other possibility would be that the USB cable provide was not the large flat connect but rather the small six sided tube-like USB mini connector. If that is the case, they packed the wrong cable.

The 53724 is water resistant.It should sustain a mild mist rain but not a full blown storm or by dropping it into lake. inside the speaker mic, it has a water resistant film draped over the the face of it,also there is one draped over the front of the tiny microphone.However if one removes these protective films,the mic will be ineffective against resisting the elements of nature,but in doing so the transmitting audio will increase as will the receive audio. This is not really needed since the mic is set up just fine the way it is manufactured. By adding the 53724 you're transmit modulation will increase by as much a 50% if the radio itself is well insulated against water,this means you don't have to eat the radios on microphone itself to pump up modulation, the 53724 does increase modulation.I hope this answers your question.73's!

      "anybody else trouble tuning external antenna red line swr readings connected mobile adapter\tIf your SWR reading was higher on channel 40 than it was on channel 1, then it simply means the antenna is too long. If it was higher on channel 1 than it was on channel 40, it is too short. This is really easy to change if you own a tunable-tip antenna. If you own an antenna like this, you can simply unlock the tip and raise or lower the antenna. Continue tuning until you reach a good ratio. If you own a fiberglass whip antenna, it is a little more difficult. First, you have to remove the tip and cut until you can access the wire coil. If it needs to be shortened, you have to begin cutting in around \" increments until it is correct. Now, if it is too long, you have to take the top coil and continue moving it out in slight increments until it is correct. Hope this helps.\n",

They're inexpensive, only a few dollars. I've had DBX for a few years now with excellent results. No distortion, just excellent professional sound quality. I bought it off of Amazon. You might have to go to the musical instrument section on Amazon to find it. It does boost the volume and sound but whether it would act as a good preamp I'm not sure.

      "difference mdrv6 mdr 7506\tBoth are excellent and very similar. The MDRV6 was the original design of the two and was issued a few years earlier. The components, drivers, ancillary parts of both models appear to be virtually identical. The MDR 7506 was issued by Sony at the behest of recording & mixing engineers who preferred a less pronounced bass and a more prominently enhanced mid and upper mid-range tonal balance (NOT for listening enjoyment reasons!... but to more readily detect noise and distortions in the recording and mixing process... Live DJ's also seem to prefer the 7506 model at public events because the enhanced mid-range brightness helps drown out ambient hall sounds and crowd noises). The V6 and 7506 sound quite similar to most folks. Although I can usually detect a very subtle and nuanced difference between the V6 and 7506, I can only hear a meaningful difference between the two models on less than 1 out of 10 recordings in my collection. I prefer the V6 because it has all the mid and upper mid-range \"sparkle\", clarity & brightness sufficient to suit my taste and (to my ears) the V6 packs a much more impressive and clean tight bass wallop on those recordings that do feature and emphasize extreme dynamic range, powerful super fast transients, excessive deep bass elements, and/or contain very loud percussive passages.\n",
      "voice coil\tMoving-coil The moving coil driver, more commonly referred to as a \"dynamic\" driver is the most common type used in headphones. The operating principle consists of a stationary magnetic element affixed to the frame of the headphone which sets up a static magnetic field. The magnetic element in headphones is typically composed of ferrite or neodymium. The diaphragm, typically fabricated from lightweight, high stiffness to mass ratio cellulose, polymer, carbon material, or the like, is attached to a coil of wire (voice coil) which is immersed in the static magnetic field of the stationary magnet. The diaphragm is actuated by the attached voice coil, when the varying current of an audio signal is passed through the coil. The alternating magnetic field produced by the current through the coil reacts against the static magnetic field in turn, causing the coil and attached diaphragm to move the air, thus producing sound. Modern moving-coil headphone drivers are derived from microphone capsule technology.\n",

I suggest you use \"Google\" to research if your radio antenna connection is compatible; i.e. positive \"tip\" or \"negative\" tip. You will notice in the photos of the Sangean ANT-60 the large end \"clips\" onto the whip antenna and the opposite end is the plug-in with the end in question. The \"reel\" out antenna wire just requires something to attach the \"reel body\" to any structure.

      "grundig s450dlx sw radio wanted antenna connect 75 ohm coax connector back\tHi, Your Grundig S450DLX uses \"F\" Type connectors so you will need an F Male to a 3.5mm Female adapter. It may take some looking to find one. I recommend trying to find a short flexible pigtail type as to not put stress on the radio connector. If you are handy & can solder you can make your own. Though not optimal it does also come with an adapter that clips onto the radios mast. If you have trouble finding or making an adapter & want to use this ANT-60 only for this radio you could modify the adapter that it comes with by just cutting off the clip part(leave some wire on it in case you ever want to restore it) & adding an F connector to the wire. Just solder the wire to the center pin. Nice radio, Have fun!\n",

      "run router hooked cable modem\tYes, But first of all this 4 port hub is not a router. A router is an active device that monitors it's RJ45 ports, when it senses the presence of a connection it interrogates the device, and the device hand shakes with it by requesting an IP address. The router issues the IP, no two devices on a net can not have the same IP. Only the ports 1 thru 4 should be used for port expansion. 1 is the input, leaving the other 3, the 5th Hub port is not used here. I have a 8 port Hub near my cable modem (FIOS now, was Time Warner) that remotely feeds this 4 port Hub in my garage, and it in turn feeds a second 4 port Hub in my man cave why out back. At the man cave I have a second wireless Internet Access point which is done by taking a wireless router and disabling it's DNS, so it does not issue an IP address, and acts like a Hub with a wireless access point, only one router is permitted on a network and it's viewable wireless name has to be different from the parent main wireless router. The Hub receives the data signal, re-amplifies it, and make it available locally on it's port. A CAT 5 cable has a range of 300 feet, 100 meters, by re-amplifying the signal it can be extended another 300 feet, or where ever you need a connection, etc.\n",

A switch basically expands the number of ethernet connections on your router. So far I'm having issues with this switch because it kills the wireless connection to my computer... or makes it run REALLY slow. I subscribed to the new U-verse package from AT&T. They had to install the router inside the closet of my master bedroom due to the way my house is wired. Anyway, I have a xbox 360 and a playstation 3 that I wanted to connect directly to the router (wireless sucks for video game consoles). My router is downstairs, and my consoles are upstairs, so they installed an ethernet outlet upstairs (connects directly to the router). Since I only have ONE ethernet outlet and I don't want to have to unplug and plug in the cables every time I switch between the xbox 360 and ps3, so the U-verse technician advised me to buy this switch. So I have two video game consoles attached to the switch, and I have my computer connected via wireless. The switch apparently hogs the connection, rendering my wireless connection to my computer useless... I have to unplug my switch in order to surf the internet. It's ridiculous. I'll be returning this switch and have a tech install another ethernet outlet.\n",

      "plan use symphony best magnification function dim lighting\tDavey B.'s analysis--and his recommendation based on that analysis--is incorrect: the field of view of a telescope (or binocular) depends on the eyepiece and the focal length of the objective, not on the diameter of the objective. Interchangeable eyepieces for telescopes are marked with their apparent field of view (the angular field as it appears to the eye), and that angle divided by the telescope magnification determines the system field of view. Non-interchangeable eyepiece telescopes and binoculars (such as these) have specifications for field of view. The field of view is in the Specifications table for this family of binoculars. For example, this line of binoculars has four models with a 32 mm objective: two with a FOV of 240 ft at 1000 yds and two with a FOV of 180 ft at 1000 yds. Same objective diameter, different FOVs. Similarly, there are four models with 25 mm objectives; at 1000 yds distance, two have 300-ft FOVs and two have 240-ft FOVs. The diameter of the objective determines how much light the telescope collects. That and the magnification determine how bright the image will be. The objective diameter divided by the magnification gives the diameter of the Exit Pupil (also in the Specifications table), which is the diameter of the bundle of light that exits the telescope. If you hold the binoculars at arm's length and point it at a uniform field, like the sky, and look at the eyepiece, you will see the disk of light. The pupil of the eye can open to between 2 mm and 8 mm, depending on the brightness of what it is looking at (also varying person to person and with age), so if an exit pupil were to be larger than 8 mm, not all the light could enter the eye, although such a large exit pupil would allow misalignment of the exit pupil and the eye pupil without losing more light. Large exit pupils (and therefore large objective diameters) are important for night viewing, but for daytime or a well-lit symphony stage, 3 mm or even 2 mm will be adequate. Brightness is also affected by the transmission of light through the telescope, which is mainly determined by the number of surfaces and the quality of the antireflection coatings on each surface. From brand-to-brand, or from line-to-line within a brand, that can vary quite a bit, so the better brands will often also specify a transmission quality. The brightness will depend on the product of the transmission and the square of the exit pupil diameter. In Davey's examples, the 10x32 has a 3.2 mm exit pupil and his 12x25 has a 2.1 mm exit pupil, so the 10x32 will be noticeably brighter. A 10x50 would give a 5 mm exit pupil, so would be brighter in dim light, but at a symphony, the eye pupil would probably contract to less than 5 mm and not use all the light. So for the symphony, any of the binoculars should be adequately bright except possibly the 2 mm or 2.1 mm exit pupil models, so it comes down to what tradeoff do you want to make between being able to watch a group of performers vs. looking at the detail of one performer (that is, which Field of View would you prefer), the size/weight of the binocular, and the eye relief distance.\n",

      "want buy ipod iphonebut know adapter need buy together give advice thanks lot\tIpods and iphones use a 1/8 inch jack. Some headphones are terminated in a 1/8 inch jack, and some are terminated in a 1/4 inch jack. The HD600 I had was an older version that had an 1/8\" jack, and for that you don't need an adapter. If you have a 1/4\" jack, then you can get a 1/4 to 1/8 inch adapter, which are commonly available on amazon or radioshack or anywhere. The other issues is that an iphone or ipod really doesn't have the necessary power to drive the HD600. I would suggest taking a look at the HD598 instead. But, if you're dead set on the HD600, then you can get one, just be mindful that you may need to get a headphone amp for it, and that out of an iphone it may not be the best value for dollar headphone you can get. The HD600 is really made for professional and stationary desktop systems, with a high-quality source and a headphone amp of some sort, or at least an integrated receiver. That's where it really shines. On the other hand, it's one of a handful of headphones under $1k that I would whole-handedly recommend. The headphone hobby has really gone to the dogs, and there are lots of overpriced, under-performing headphones out there on the market. But, the HD600 is not one of them, and it's one of the best value for dollar deals out there - the others being the Koss ESP950 and Stax SR-207, if you're building a stationary, desktop-based system, and Sennheiser HD598 and Momentum if you're building a portable-based system. On that note - if isolation is important, the Sennheiser Momentum is worth a good look. While not as good as the HD600 in terms of absolute fidelity, it's a quality closed headphone and is easy to drive by just about anything.\n",

Also, check head-fi.org or innerfidelity.com for more info on headphones amps/DACs where you can find reviews.

I've been using relatively inexpensive Nady Starpower mics for years, and they performed well with these machines with the appropriate adaptor. The quality of construction is good on the decks, so the plugs tend to stay inserted, and don't fall out like they did with a lesser machine that I tried first.

Due to this effect, the lens won't give you any wide views at all on the T3. Also, with a DSLR, it will be much easier to see the many optical short-comings of this lens.

While this lens will work on your T3i, I would instead recommend the Canon 55-250mm IS which has better optics and has IS image stabilization which helps control blurring caused by slight hand movements while holding the camera.

The USM version has an ultrasonic micro-motor for focusing while the non-USM uses a electric conventional motor. Micro-motor USM isn't much faster or quieter while focusing than a conventional motor. This is in contrast to Canon's professional lenses which use a very different type of USM (\"ring USM\") that focuses very fast and silently. Check out a used Canon 100-300mm (also discontinued) if you want the faster ring USM auto-focus and better optics for a reasonable price.\n",

I assume one of the reasons you have a 6D is for the extremely high-end image quality but this lens will degrade your image quality to a very significant degree (much like putting worn out $15 tires on a $150,000 Porsche 911). I would recommend saving your money for a high quality telephoto which will help bring out the potential of this camera rather than limiting it. At the very least, perhaps the Canon 70-300mm IS lens which at least has image stabilization, otherwise, you're also going to need a tripod.\n",

Basically a USM lens will focus slightly faster, and make less noise than a non USM Lens. Also it will use slightly less battery power. However if you are using the lens for mainly static subjects, distant landscapes maybe, it won't make a lot of difference which you have. If on the other hand you are trying to photograph birds in flight, USM will be better. There is also a 70-300mm lens with image stabilisation if you have the money, that lens will effectively allow you to hand hold the lens at 300mm without blurring through camera shake.

      "non usm verses usm im learning\tSee photogray guide web site below. www.slrphotographyguide.com/camera/canon-digital-slr/us If you notice your Canon digital SLR camera lens has the letters USM written on the side, it means the lens has a small motor built into the body. Hence, USM is short for UltraSonic Motor. It is important to note that there are two different types of USM lenses. A Ring ultrasonic, is the one you want to purchase. Then there are Micromotor ultrasonic drives that Canon places into their cheaper lenses. Unfortunately, they also letter these cheaper versions with USM as well. While these cheaper versions are quieter, they don't however focus as quickly as a true ring ultrasonic lens. Therefore, you need to check the lens specifications before purchasing to ensure it is a ring ultrasonic lens, and not a cheaper version created for what is rumoured to be marketing reasons. What are the advantages of using Canons range of ring USM camera lens? *The main advantage of using a ring USM, is that the motor is built into the lens so that it can auto focus faster than a standard lens. *Canon's USM / UltraSonic Motors, are also famous for being quieter than standard motors used in cheaper lenses. This is useful for wildlife photographers, where animals and insects could become spooked from noisy camera parts. Are there any disadvantages to using a USM camera lens? *A USM lens will cost you a little extra than one without it. *USM lenses are generally heavier than standard ones. You might need to take this into account if like me, you tend to carry around 3 at a time.

Now, I shoot wildlife photography of wild animals. For me, that time difference in crucial. You'll want that should you ever be shooting moving subjects, like animals or sports events, for example.

      "lenses canon eos rebel xt could someone tell point website shows lenses go digital eos rebel xt\tI got my xti last year and had the same questions. After much reading and many classes ... I can tell you that the lens mount on the Rebel is the same mount as the Canon film slr cameras. In fact from what I have read it uses the same lens mount as cameras that go back like 15 years. Look for lenses that work with \"EF\" mounts. If you are looking at portraits ... try 100mm I have heard good and bad about all of the different lens types, IS, USM, L etc ... so I think it is dependent on your style, how you will be using the photos, what type of pictures you will be taking, how much money you want to spend and how picky you are. I think the best advice I could give is to find someone who is where you wannabe with your photography and see what he uses otherwise you will be getting all sorts of advice from peopole who may not even be into the same photograpy as you. Some good advice I got last year was to visit a true camera store and see the lenses up close. Maybe ask for a demonstration. If you go during a slow time the salesman will have more time to talk with you about the lenses and hopefully you will determine that he knows what he is talking about and listen to his advice? Once you have a good idea of what you want ... then check on-line for a deal :o) If you feel that you have gone as far as you can go with your current lens ... I suggest moving up to one of the 75-300 lenses. Since I do not personally own any of them (YET) I cannot rate them for you :o( I use my camera for everything from Web site images to poster size prints. I have taken awesome action shots, wonderful portraits, great close ups of flowers, etc with my rebel xti! I've spent almost a year with the original lens. I imagine that's not what you wanna hear ... cuz when I first got my camera I wanted alll of the lenses ;o) and accessories! I think waiting has made me a better informed consumer. It isnt the lens necessarily that makes the picture .... but the user ;o) If you have Photoshop the 55MM is better than you think ... cuz you can crop the pictures (they are HUGE on the largest setting) ... remember that the resolution of your image is only going to be as good as the resolution of your printer. I'm sure everyone has an opinion on the lenses ... only you can know for sure which one is right for you. Some things you can purchase if you DONT go with the L series ;o) ... Polarizer filter UV filter flash more memory spare battery tripod monopod wireless remote I hope you come back and review whatever lens you decide on!!\n",

There is a telescoping antenna that works better, or you can get an adapter at Radio Shack and use a high quality magnetic roof antenna on your car...But Cobra hand-helds don't put out more than 2 watts. I tested it on a 35 foot antenna and picked up someone at about 1 1/2 miles...That's about it. If you want some power get a Boefeng Ham radio (about $40) ar a Magnum 357 HP EXPORT RADIO, that has about 80 watts, and Ham and CB frequencies, and a Ham Operators License. But Boefeng doesn't pick up CB channels... A Uniden 520XL CB from Wall Mart works very well for $39 with a good magnetic roof antenna on your car...The Hand-Held CB's just don't have much power, nor the necessary antenna... All CB's are rated at 4 watts, so if you are looking at an expensive CB, forget it, You're not getting any more transmit power. Get a cheap Uniden 520 XL 4 watts, or get something with power like a Magnum 357HP (80 watts) and set it up for all channels with a good antenna...\n",

      "tested works nikon d1x\tIt will work on any DSLR in the auto sensor mode, in that it will fire when it should. Just keep in mind that it is not TTL capable, so if your camera body is set at ISO 400 and your lens is set at f8 aperture for example, the auto sensor dial on the front of the flash would be set on the red mark, and the flash's auto sensor should expose properly as long as you're within the distance range indicated on the scale on the side dial. Just remember to adjust the manual three-position flash head to match the focal length of your lens.

      "could someone explain comment older flashes damage digital cameras vivitar 283 383 want use panasonic fz70\tIt is not really a matter of 'older flash units' so much as what voltage the flash unit puts out to the camera. You need to check out one of the forums for your Panasonic camera and ask them what voltage the camera uses. Some flash units are not compatible with some cameras, so you really need to make sure they are compatible FIRST. I had the same problem with my Fujifilm HS10 but fount the Vivitar was indeed a good fit for it. It is probably best to go on the Panasonic (Lumix) website and ask them which flash units they recommend for your camera. One thing to keep in mind, the vivitar is a manual unit that cannot be controlled by my Fuji's hot shoe other than as a trigger. I have to set the vivitar up myself, but it works beautifully.\n",
